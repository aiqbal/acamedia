== Installation

After generating the login system, edit your app/controllers/application.rb
and app/helpers/application_helper.rb files. The beginning of your
ApplicationController should look something like this:

  require 'localization'

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Localization

And your ApplicationHelper module should look like this:

  module ApplicationHelper
    include Localization

Additionally, you'll need to includes this module as appropriate to use it
elsewhere, such as in your views. You also need to add the following at the end
of your config/environment.rb file:

require 'environments/localization_environment'
require 'localization'
Localization::load_localized_strings

Under the 'enviroments' subdirectory, you'll find localization_environment.rb.
Edit this file as necessary...

== Requirements

This module requires iconv support. This is installed by default on most
*nix distributions, but not on Windows.

You need to put your translations in the files lang/[language].yaml. Then, the
:default_language => [language] configuration variable will ensure that the
appropriate file is loaded.

== How to use it 

When you want a localized string such as "localized_hello", simply create a new
entry in all supported lannguage YAML files of the form:

In en.yaml:

localized_hello: hello

In sp.yaml:

localized_hello: hola

Then in your code, you assign the string as follows:

str_var = l(:localized_hello)

In the environments/localization_environment file, set the
configuration variable :default_language to either 'en' or 'sp.' That's it!
